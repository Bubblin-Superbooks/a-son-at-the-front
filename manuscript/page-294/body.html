He threw back his shoulders, as if to shake off a weight. “I—feel exactly as Brant does,” he declared.</p><p>“You—you feel as he does? You, George’s father? But a father has never done all he can for his son! There’s always something more that he can do!”</p><p>The words, breaking from her in a cry, seemed suddenly to change her from an ageing doll into a living and agonized woman. Campton had never before felt as near to her, as moved to the depths by her. For the length of a heart-beat he saw her again with a red-haired baby in her arms, the light of morning on her face.</p><p>“My dear—I’m sorry.” He laid his hand on hers.</p><p>“Sorry—sorry? I don’t want you to be sorry. I want you to do something—I want you to save him!”</p><p>He faced her with bent head, gazing absently at their interwoven fingers: each hand had forgotten to release the other.</p></div> </div>
